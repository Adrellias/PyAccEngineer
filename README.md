#### Possible problems

- If you get the error `python isn't recognized...` and python is installed, [check here to add it to the path](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-add-python-to-path-variable-in-windows)

### How to use it

- One user connect as server and the others connect to it
- [OPTIONAL] Chose the same username as in acc ("name surname") then so the user driving will be highlighted in green.
- `Update values` will refresh the information on the strategy page to the lastest value in game (mfd page)
- `Set Strategy` will send a command to the user who is currently driving and set the strategy accordingly

### Run the server as headless (dedicated server)

Simply run the Server.py, by default port is 4269 (TCP) and 4270 (UDP) use -u or --udp_port to change the UDP port and -t or --tcp_port to change the TCP port

```powershell
python headless_server.py -u 4270 -tcp_port 4269
```

To stop the server simply press ctrl C in the cmd / powershell / windows terminal

## **Warnings**

- **Tyre change must be on before the strategy setter is started**
- **At least one pit strategy must be set or different from the default**
- When the strategy setter is started the driving user shouldn't alt tab (duh)
