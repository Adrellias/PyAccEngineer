```
python Server.py -p 4269
```

To stop the server simply press ctrl C in the terminal

## Warnings

* At least one pit strategy must be set or different from the default
* When the strategy setter is started the driving user shouldn't alt tab (duh)
* Tyre change must be on before the strategy setter is started
* The app can't change driver (yet, I hope)
